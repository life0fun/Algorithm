# Interview Questions on Algorithm and Coding

Here is a collection of solutions for some algorithm questions during coding interview.

Code interview is hard. I have failed many interviews with easy problems or problems I can and have solved previous but I just could not perform during the interview settings. I am frustrated by this and here I put all the coding problems I have solved in this repo hoping I can have a little bit justification for my underperformance. 


## The Reasons

After some retrospect, for me, there are two main problems, one is that I tend to rush to something immature in the scare of taking long time to think. The other is that my brain simply shuts down under the pressure most of time.

In the fear of giving bad impression of taking long time on simple questions, I hastily rush to some statement while over simplified the problem. Once I started do that, of course I will miss some important details and rush to another statement to rescue this statement, and eventually failed. I could have done better if I can relax and take pressure better.

The other problem is that my brain shuts down under pressure. At one time I even convinced myself I am a dumb guy until one day I came across 2013 TED winner talk by Dr. Sugata Mitra: Build a School in the Cloud. It is one of the greatest talk I have watched. At time 14min 11 second, he showed that there is evidence from neuroscience that human brain shuts down under threaten. Ah.....F**k ! why I did not learn it earlier.
